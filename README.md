# editable
something i made when i was bored idk

created in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) and transpiled to javascript using the js backend.

basically just copy and paste main.js into a bookmark url and once you click it you'll be able to edit everything on the current website you're on, took about 5 lines of code idk again i was bored
